# What's Done

* The English manual up toand including 'Component Overview'

# TODO

* Fixups to the English documentation:
  * Code blocks are in the wrong place, usually starting a line or two after
    they're supposed to, and ending without their last line.
  * Most internal links aren't translated: [doc ref title] -> :doc:`title <ref>`
  * Most methods and classes aren't marked with :php:class: or :php:meth: roles
  * A few caution/note/warning blocks aren't properly marked up: .. note::
  * Tables are screwed. Translation to reST simple tables is annoying.
* All the Japanese documentation, including titles

# Vim functions

Don't know how useful they'll be to other people, but a few Vim functions I've
been using are in .vimfunctions.
